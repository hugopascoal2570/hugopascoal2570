### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, my name is Hugo Pascoal. I have a degree in Systems Analysis and Development. I am currently looking for my first opportunity in the job market. So that I can expand my knowledge, and so that I can add something of value to my future colleagues. I'm still starting, I have a lot to learn. But I really want to grow in this market.

If you want to talk to me , ðŸ‘‡.
